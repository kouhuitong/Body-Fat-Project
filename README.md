# Body-Fat-Project
STAT628-Module2-Group11
## Goal
Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly. In this project, your group will come up with a simple, robust, and accurate “rule-of-thumb” to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements. Your “rule-of-thumb” will be based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.

## Summary
`xxx.ipynb` is an summary of our modeling process in a Jupyter Notebook.

Our model is based on xxx and A, B, C, D are involved in the model.

There are xxx folders providing more details.

## Code
There are n R code files:

## Data
`BodyFat.csv` is the raw data set of available measurements include age, weight, height, bmi, and various body circumference measurements. In particular, the variables listed below (from left to right in the data set) are:

- Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
- Density determined from underwater weighing
- Age (years)
- Weight (lbs)
- Height (inches)
- Adioposity (bmi)
- Neck circumference (cm)
- Chest circumference (cm)
- Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
- Hip circumference (cm)
- Thigh circumference (cm)
- Knee circumference (cm)
- Ankle circumference (cm)
- Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
- Forearm circumference (cm)
- Wrist circumference (cm)
